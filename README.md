# Campus Enrollment-website
The website is about the campous enrollment process during the admissions in the college.The traditional campus enrollment process, often managed through manual document submission, is time-consuming and prone to inefficiencies. This project proposes the development of a web-based platform designed to streamline and optimize the enrollment process by enabling students to submit documents online. The primary objectives of the system are to “reduce paperwork”,”enhance operational efficiency”, and “significantly decrease the time required for in-person enrollment”.
