The website is about the campous enrollment process during the admissions in the college.The traditional campus enrollment process, often managed through manual document submission, is time-consuming and prone to inefficiencies. This project proposes the development of a web-based platform designed to streamline and optimize the enrollment process by enabling students to submit documents online. The primary objectives of the system are to “reduce paperwork”,”enhance operational efficiency”, and “significantly decrease the time required for in-person enrollment”. Additionally, the platform aims to improve the overall user experience for both students and administrative staff. With 24/7 accessibility, students can conveniently submit their documents at any time, reducing the need for physical presence and facilitating a more seamless enrollment process.
